    <<~EOS
      Run cube up to download and start the VM (~1.1 GB on first use).
      brew upgrade cube updates the launcher; cube upgrade updates the VM.
      VM data lives in ~/.cube and is kept when this formula is uninstalled.
      To delete it, explicitly run cube destroy --yes before uninstalling.
